## About Laravel Ecommerce v-1

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-catalog page where all products will be displayed to buyers.
-A product details page where buyers can find more information about the product.
-A checkout system, where buyers can enter the shipping address and pay.
-Login and registration pages so buyers can register or login to their account.
-Account dashboard for customers where they can see recent orders placed, or can change their account details.
-An admin area where shop owner can log in and manage followings:
--Manage store settings.
--Manage products, categories, brands, product attributes.
--Manage sales orders and can generate reports.
--Manage payment methods available to customers.
--Manage Shipping methods available to customers.
--Manage admin users so other staff members use the admin area.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
